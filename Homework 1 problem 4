##Homework 1 problem 4.

import fractions as fc
import numpy as np

vel=input('Insert the traveling velocity as a fraction compared to the speed of light (i.e. 3/5, 4/5, etc) ' )

v=float(fc.Fraction(vel))


gamma=round(1/(np.sqrt(1-(v**2))), 3)

print('Your velocity is', float(fc.Fraction(vel)),'c')

print('Your Lorentz/dilation factor is ', gamma)




x=float(input('Now what is distance in light years? '))

trest=round(x/v, 2)

print('For an observer at rest, the traveler will take ', trest, 'years to arrive at their destination')

ttrav=round(trest/gamma, 2)

print('For the traveler however, it will take', ttrav, 'years')



#when we run through the program inserting the values of .99c for the velocity and 10 light years for the distance, we get
#10.10 years for the observer at rest, and 1.42 years for the traveler.
